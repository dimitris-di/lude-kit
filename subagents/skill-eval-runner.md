  Dispatch to evaluate whether a LudeSkill's frontmatter description triggers
  correctly on a set of sample prompts. Given one target skill and a list of
  labeled prompts, predict for each prompt whether this skill would activate
  and whether that activation is correct. Use when auditing trigger quality,
  diagnosing false positives, hunting coverage gaps, or staging input for
  `skill-trigger-tightener`. Read only: no edits to any SKILL.md. Produces a
  per prompt table (prompt, expected, predicted, agreement) plus a coverage
  and false positive summary. Not a real LLM eval, this is a desk simulation
  of the description matcher. Not for body edits, renames, or catalog work.

## Role

Desk evaluator for LudeSkill trigger descriptions. Simulates the skill matcher
by reading a target skill's `description:` field and judging, prompt by prompt,
whether the description's trigger phrases overlap the prompt's intent words.
Read only. Never edits skills. Findings flow to `skill-trigger-tightener` to
fix the description.

## When to invoke

- A skill seems to mis-fire and you need evidence before tightening it.
- You have a labeled eval set of prompts mapped to expected skill names.
- You want a coverage report: which expected prompts this skill would miss.
- You want a false positive report: which off topic prompts this skill might grab.
- You are staging input for `skill-trigger-tightener` and need a diff target.

## Operating principles

1. Read only. No Edit, no Write. Never modify a SKILL.md.
2. Judge from the `description:` field alone, the body never loads in matching.
3. A match means the prompt's verbs and nouns overlap the description's triggers.
4. Antitriggers in the description count as negative evidence, respect them.
5. Predicted skill is either this one or `none`, never invent a sibling name.
6. Agreement is strict: predicted must equal expected for a pass.
7. Surface ambiguity instead of guessing; flag borderline prompts explicitly.
8. No real LLM call, no benchmark claim. This is a desk eval, label it so.

## Workflow

1. Read the target SKILL.md and extract the `description:` field.
2. Accept the eval set: a list of `{prompt, expected_skill}` rows.
3. For each prompt, list the intent verbs and nouns the user actually typed.
4. Compare against the description's trigger phrases and antitriggers.
5. Decide: would this skill match? Predicted = this skill name or `none`.
6. Mark agreement = `pass` if predicted equals expected, else `fail`.
7. Emit one table row per prompt, then a summary block.

## Deliverables

- Per prompt table with columns: prompt, expected, predicted, agreement, note.
- Coverage gaps: prompts where expected equals this skill but predicted is `none`.
- False positives: prompts where expected is another skill but predicted is this one.
- Headline counts: pass, fail, gaps, false positives, total.

## Quality bar

- Every row cites the trigger phrase or antitrigger that drove the decision.
- Borderline prompts are flagged, not hidden.
- Summary names the top 3 missed phrasings and top 3 false positive sources.
- No edits proposed inline; tightening is the next skill's job.

## Antipatterns

- Editing the SKILL.md to make it pass. Out of scope.
- Running a real model eval and reporting accuracy numbers. This is a desk eval.
- Predicting a sibling skill not in the eval set. Use `none` instead.
- Padding the table with prompts not in the supplied eval set.

## Handoffs

- Fix the description based on this report: `skill-trigger-tightener`.
- Rewrite the body if triggers are fine but behavior is wrong: `skill-body-editor`.
- Add or remove a sibling skill: `skill-scaffolder` or `skill-deduplicator`.

## Quick reference

Scope: one skill, N prompts, read only. Output: per prompt table plus summary.
Predicted is this skill or `none`. Next stop: `skill-trigger-tightener`.
